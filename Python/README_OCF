## Overview

This project involves the calculation of the orientational correlation function (OCF) for the backbone Cα atoms of proteins from PDB files. 
The OCF provides insights into the stiffness of protein backbones by measuring the correlation between unit vectors connecting consecutive Cα atoms. 
The decay of this function can be fitted to an exponential model to estimate the persistence length of the protein, 
which is a measure of the maximum size over which structural fluctuations are correlated.

## Calculation Details

### Orientational Correlation Function

The orientational correlation function \( C(s) \) is defined as:
\[ C(s) = \langle \mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{n}_{i+s} \rangle \]
where:
- \( s \) is the pairwise residue separation (contour length).
- \( \mathbf{n}_i \) is the unit vector connecting Cα atoms of two consecutive residues.

### Exponential Decay Model

The decay of \( C(s) \) is modeled using an exponential decay function:
\[ C(s) = e^{-s/k} \]
where:
- \( k \) is a parameter that corresponds to the persistence length.

The persistence length \( l_p \) is estimated as:
\[ l_p = k \times 3.8 \, \text{Å} \]
where 3.8 Å is the approximate distance between consecutive Cα atoms in a protein backbone.

## Script Description

The script processes all PDB files in the current directory, calculates the OCF for each file, fits the decay to an exponential model 
to estimate \( k \) and \( l_p \), and averages the OCFs across all files. The results are saved to a log file (`OCF.log`) 
and the average OCF is plotted along with the fitted exponential curve.

### Dependencies

- `mdtraj`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `os`

### Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install mdtraj numpy matplotlib scipy

Usage
Place the script OCF_v2.py in the directory containing your PDB files.
Run the script using Python:
python OCF_v2.py

Output
The script generates the following outputs:

OCF.log: A log file containing the filename, for each processed PDB file.
graphic_OCF.dat: A data file containing the average orientational correlation function.
A plot showing the average OCF and the fitted exponential decay curve.
